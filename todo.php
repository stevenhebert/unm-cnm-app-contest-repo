TODO:



NOW: 

Resend activation
Show district number even if there are no posts
Prioritize posts by vote / determine best method to sort
Port to mobile with ionic by January 4, 2018
Add flare for officials accounts



SOON:

Prevent mail@abqtownhall from getting marked as spam
Limit activation token life span (24 hour expire)
Wire up contact form
Change state from a text field to a drop down so that only state abbreviations can be entered (sign-up & edit profile)
Show number of replies to parentPosts in parent header



LATER:

Search engine optimization
Get-text for language translation
Notify by email if password is changed and allow user to deny change if unrecognized
Basic password rules (block common passwords, min length, etc)
Issue new session when address is changed -> otherwise they still only have access to their old district and not new
Only allow user to change address once per day so they can just keep changing address to troll other districts
